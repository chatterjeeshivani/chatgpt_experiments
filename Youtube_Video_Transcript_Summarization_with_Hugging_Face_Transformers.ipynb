            " hi friends I saw this tweet the other day that said I Mentor a young lad with poor literacy skills who is starting a landscaping business I created a GPT powered Gmail account which he sends an email it responds with a text to send to that client and I thought to myself gosh darn it this is a great example about how to show how to build a web app online using Lane chain and Python and connecting to a language model like open AI so I decided to do just that and I built globalize text with streamlit which is a very simple uh platform really to deploy web apps and so what how this works is you go down you say enter your email to convert and I'm going to say hey this is Greg i'm going to work at your place I will do it it will come Monday I will come over we will do find work bye so you go ahead and you run this through and it converts the email for you to some properly formatted English which is great and you also have some controls up here where you can change it to informal tone or formal tone and I'm going to change it to American English fabulous will be working on the fence and so in this tutorial we are going to learn how to make this app from scratch literally first line of code and you can see it um and uh and we'll have some fun with it and I'm really excited to see at the end of this video what you plan on doing with your own apps and I would love to see them so please put them in the comments we'll see you soon quick interlude on this too you can actually go and check out this app yourself at globalized.streamlet.app and I'm leaving it up there for the first you know about 25 worth of API calls so if you want to go try this tool yourself go up there and go try it and let me know what you think all right first thing we want to do is we want to have an overview about what streamlit is and how it works and how to get the ergonomics set up for how you need to here so you'll notice here that I'm in my vs code and I'm first going to navigate in my terminal to my uh to my app right here and so I've navigated to the folder in my app in my terminal and I'm going to run a streamlit uh streamlit run main.pi and you'll notice in my folder right here I have two two files one's just a picture that we're going to use later but the other one is main.pi which is your main app your main python script that this is going to be running off of now I've pre-installed streamlit beforehand so you'll need to make sure that you've done that too or else this command won't work so if I go ahead and do that what it's going to do is it's going to run on my Local Host local server which is great and then it's going to start and empty out for me which is cool now uh what I want to do here is I actually want to go side by side because one of the awesome things about this app is you can make edits in your code base and it will automatically update uh in your app over here so first thing that we could do is maybe we can add a header well actually uh before we that is what we'll do add a header but we first need to import streamlin so if we're over here at main.pi and then I'm going to click save and then you'll notice over here that we get prompted do we want to rerun this script once or do we want to always rerun it and I want to click always rerun so that it will always update when we save it and you'll see here that now we have this header globalized text that's sweet I could say this to view whatever I want my header I'm going to click save and it's just going to update to my header now the most important thing in fact probably yeah the most important thing that I uh helped with my learning curve on streamline is this app will run from top down so just like regular python it'll run from top down so it'll it'll do the First Command first and then the second and the third and then fourth and then go down from there okay now some other things that we could add is we could set some page configs now if you're ever going to set a page config that needs to be the first streamline command that runs in your um that runs in your script there you can see here I changed my title up here now we can do some interesting things like put in columns into this and then we can even put in some markdown from here too so if you want to put in some columns you actually say column one column two equals uh streamlit dot columns and you're going to say I want two columns and then you're going to do some with statements and tell it what to do with those columns so I'm going to say with call one I'm going to say streamlit dot right call one and right just means it's going to give us a text box and if I do call to and then I'm going to say column two call two and I'll go ahead and save this and you can see here now that we have column one and we have column two so we could actually switch this to be three columns you need to switch that equal 3 and do call three as well so now we have a three column uh one on there which is pretty cool now another fun thing on here which you may like a little better is you can do some markdown so what it's doing here is let me say often professionals I'm going to put this in bold and let me end that cool we'll save that and we get often professionals but it's like no you know what actually I want to have a header that starts in my column two and this header is going to be two oops two so then all of a sudden we have a header inside of column two which is sweet now to recap this one more time how this is building out is every time I click save this app is going to be reloading and go from top to bottom so it's going to import streamlit it's going to set the page config do the header make the columns and go down blah blah blah blah and I'll go ahead and save this um and then what's cool is like I said you wanted to do St dot right and you could say one plus two go ahead and do that and you get three which comes out in a code language right there which is which is fun to see um so it's not too far of a stretch to see how we're going to import some link chain on here we're going to ask for some user input and in fact let's do that let's do that one example just to get some user input um so let me go down here and I'm going to say hey I'm going to I want streamlit dot text area the label is going to be nothing in fact this is labeled placeholder is just what the placeholder text is going to be in there and the key is the email input this is how we'll identify it and we'll have some input text so let me go ahead and save that and then all of a sudden we have an input place where we can do some do some you know if you can get some user input from there and then what I want to do is I want to write user input so I'm going to go ahead and save this and all of a sudden we get uh our user input that was right that was we wrote right down below now if I reload this you'll notice that this user input starts as blank and nothing is getting written underneath however it's hard to tell but because this is blank there is no user input we are actually writing some user input text down there so but there is no user input text so what I want to do is I want to say hey if user info text meaning if there is any then write it if there's no user input text then don't write it and so the way that we could try this out let me just make this super explicit um now there is user input text let me go ahead and save this and you'll notice Let Me rerun this and you notice that nothing comes in down here even though we wrote that but if I put this is user input text and I run that then it says oh now there's user input text because it reran and anytime you update anything on the page it's going to rerun from start to finish so we have our user input text there awesome there is the basics of how to do streamlit in like five minutes let's go into actually making the app the globalized tech snap for us all right now we're going to start making our globalized text app and so the first thing I did in my terminal I went to my folder and I'm going to run streamlit extreme lit run main.pi and what that's going to do is it's going to run a okay cool I think that there we go so there's my main dot Pi that it's running right there and you can see here that it's successfully running on my Local Host which is what I'm doing it from now over here is going to be my main.pi code and what's cool is that once we start importing our items we can start to use them right away and so the first things that I want to do for the globalized text is I want to put a header and I want to set a page uh config and so let me go ahead and do that and let me save that and I need to click always rerun so that anytime I save it it's going to be updating on our end so we imported streamlined we set the page config we have globalized header as a text right there okay now the next thing I want to do is I want to add in kind of my my boiler boilerplates description about what's going on here so I'm first going to add in some columns I'm going to add in a two column up at the top because I want to describe what the heck this app does in the first place and then I'm going to do um it's a markdown it's gonna I'm gonna say in column one I want to put some markdown with st.markdown and I'm going to put in just plain markdown with some links here and then in column two I want to put in an image so I'm going to say dot image specify which the image is which it's going to be a screenshot of the text I'm going to say the width to give it some uh some size and then I'm going to put in a caption on there too so let me go ahead and run this and oh sweet now we can see that this has been updated with two columns and we have our image with a caption and all that other good stuff from there so then up now I need to start building out where we're going to input our user input forms and so I want to put in a header and markdown is easy for me to do that I'm going to put in enter your email to convert um but then let me see yeah but then what actually yeah let's do this but I want to call in the user input form so I'm going to create a quick function I'm going to say st.txt area and this should be label equals I'm not going to give it a label because I'm going to give it I'd rather deal that in markdown I'm going to say a placeholder which is the input text or the placeholder text that will be in the first place and then the key which is email input if we end up using that later and then so what's cool is that this email input variable will be the output of get text which will be the text that was input by the user let me go ahead and run this and we get your email right here so if I wanted to see how this was um how this was written let me do St dot write and I'm going to take the email input and write that and so let me go ahead and say that I'm going to click here this is my email input and I'll go ahead and control enter that and we get this is my email input right here awesome so let me do my next my next header which is going to be where our converted email is going to go and then I would also want to put in some controls for the user to have as well and these will be input controls that will then pass the line chain prompt template and so in order to do this I want to put them below uh here's your email to convert and put in some columns out there and I want to put in two columns and these two columns will be two input Fields so one is going to be a select box and the other one is actually going to be a select box too which will have the question which tone do you want your email to have and then which English dialect do you want your email to have and I'll put in the options for what I want right there I'll go ahead and save this and then all of a sudden we get those in there right here in their drop downs which is super cool now the piece that I want to um the piece that I want to emphasize is anytime you update these selections it will rerun the entire app for you so think of it as like a big refresh every time you switch something on here now we're not doing anything so there's no updates and it's not changing anything so you won't see that okay um so then what I'd like to do next is let's do this one let's do this uh let's put our output here so what I want to do is if email input so that means that if this variable is present now when you first load the page there is no user input so this email will be basically null and so it this piece of code whatever I run below here isn't going to run because it's null I go if email input and then I just want to write the email input so I save that let me give this a good refresh and so we can see what this will look like and so you can see it's blank right here nothing's nothing gets written but then I'll say this is my text and let me go ahead and run this and it says this is my text now this is my updated text now before I even I'm not going to click enter on this I just want to show you if I well actually you can see that it just it just updated right there so it did a little refresh because I knew I was switching those but anytime you mess with these inputs it is going to switch income so that's my email input now here's what the really interesting part happens because what I need to do is I need to take this email input and instead of writing out just the email input one for one I want to pass it through a prompt template through link chain with the configuration that the user has set above and then I want to get the output from openai as to what is a properly formatted email so in order to do that I'm first going to set up a prompt template that I can use account and if you have questions about how to use prompt templates with previous videos on that now because the prompt template code has nothing to do with streamlit I'm going to put this above my set page config because it won't um I don't need to stream it to to help with that so the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to set up my prompt template first and I'm going to say template equals and give it some three curly brackets and I'm going to put in a prompt template here now this prompt templ I did beforehand with a little bit of prompt Engineering in there as well now there's probably going to be some purest prompt engineers in there that say this isn't correct but um it works for me and I'll probably do some optimization on this before I deploy it live but below is an email that is poorly worded your goal is to properly format convert to tone convert dialect and then I give some examples about different tones examples about different dialects I just pulled up what are American words and what are British words online which helped it here and then below is the email tone and dialect so I did Tone and then a token for what my tone eventually will be from the user dialect dialect and email email and then finally your response and colon now these are special uh tokens right here because this will be replaced with the text that we get from users and the selections that they made okay now let's actually make our proper prompt template that so far is just a string and with that I'm going to say temp template equals prompt template and this tells me that I need to input or import prompt template cool I'm going to say the input variables are going to be tone dialect and email and then I'm going to pass it the template right here I'll go ahead and give that a save always rerun and nothing changed here because we didn't update anything okay now the next thing I want to do is I want to load my language model and so the way I'm going to load the language model is I'm going to create another small function that is going to be load llm and in this case I'm going to load open AI with the temperature and temperature equals zero meaning it's not going to be too creative and in fact you know I kind of want this to increase a little bit I'll do temperature 0.5 with open Ai and that tells me I need to import that so I won't cool and then it's going to load llm and it's going to um it's going to load that up for me now this is going to throw me an error because it's going to say I can't find my API key which yep that's expected you can't find your open API key so what you need to do is you need to make sure that your API key is either in your script which is not recommended because you don't want to hard code it anywhere or it's in your environment variables that this can then pull from so I'm going to pause the video and I'm actually going to just set this in my environment variable to uh to not need this for you all right we're back and so I just uh updated my environment variable and so you can go ahead and do this yourself too now when I save this I can actually properly load the llm because this open AI package is pulling in the environment variable for me cool now I have my language model that I want to use here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say uh down here if there's email input so if the user has actually given us an email then what I want you to do is I want you to write something but what I want you to write instead of the email input I'm going to say formatted email equals and then this is where the really magic the big magic will happen is I'm going to say llm so I'm going to pass in uh what like let's let me make this a bit more explicit um I'm going to say prompt with email equals The Prompt that we just made which is formatted with the tone with the option dialect and with the email that we had and so then what I'm going to pass to actually let me I I just want to really step through this with y'all just to make sure I'm not skipping over too many steps so the first thing I'm going to do before I do anything with passing it to the llm I want to take this prompt with email and I actually want to write out the prompt with email so I'm going to go ahead and save this and let me say this is my email that I'm passing to the um app let me go ahead oops and then so what it's doing here is it's giving us the prompt because I just asked it to print out the prompt so this whole thing will actually get sent over to open Ai and so you can see here uh that we get the tone is formal the dialect is English because that's what the settings are up here and this is my email that I'm going to be passing to the app and then we go from there and then your response so um we're going to pass this to open Ai and it's going to give us the response here and the way we're actually going to do that is we're going to pass in our prompt which is this thing right here and we're going to pass that into the language model and then we're going to get the properly formatted email as the response so in order to update this I'm just going to write that properly formatted email let me go ahead and run this I'll save that always rerun and so here it tries to give us an email which is really cool because this doesn't even look like an email in the first place but let's do uh that better example that I was mentioning beforehand which is seem to have it if anybody knows how to fix this pixelation problem with OBS I would love to know hey this this is Greg and I'm going to work at your place it will be Monday when I come over we will do fence work bye and go ahead and run this and cool it takes this email and it does the properly formatted email let me do British English and we and we get a little different in the kind regards and Carry Out fence work I mean that's our app and so you can see how we did this and made this entire app in 79 lines of code which really there's nothing too crazy here that's it's overly complex so in the next section what we're going to do is we're actually going to deploy this all right next thing we're going to do is we're going to push push to our remote repository I added two more files in here one is just the readme and then the other one is a requirements uh so that spiritually knows how to do the build so in order to do this head over to GitHub click new I'm globalize text stream lit I'm going to do public okay cool create repository and now we have this and then once you're in your terminal um and you're in your folder that all your code is in you're just going to Simply follow the commands that are on there so I'm going to get in it get uh ad I'm going to add everything I'm going to get commit first commit cool all that is there and then get Branch um Main and then I'm gonna copy and paste that one copy and paste that one get remote okay cool and then get push you origin name it's gonna ask for my passcode I'm gonna do that awesome so all of a sudden we just push to it and if I give this a Reload we can see that our code is there right now so let's head over to streamlit and deploy this thing so let's go to streamlit.io okay cool I'm going to sign in my closer here all right so I already logged in and uh haven't done anything special here this is the example app that I was doing beforehand but I'm going to click new app and it's going to ask me where do you want to pull it from and here is the repo that I just made globalize text streamlit I'm going to go ahead and do that that one main branch and the main file path is not uh streamlight.op is gonna be main.pi let's see what advanced settings here so you actually do want to set your environment variables because remember we use the open AI API key as the environment variable I'm going to go ahead and do that all right just set the environment variable and as simple as we're going to go ahead and say go deploy so let's see what this will do for us it'll take our app and it's going to load it up and deploy it for us and the app is in the oven sweet that sounds good so we now it has our app and who knows that's kind of going off of a gross URL here but if I click the GitHub you can see where it's pulling from which is our new repo that we just did and we have all this I'm going to close this off to the side we don't need to see that and we have our piece here so if we're going to do this again let me take my text that I had previously and let's see if we can make this work hopefully the environment variable works that is freaking awesome that's so cool to see and yes that's working as expected right there now if you wanted to do a custom URL here I believe you're going to go to settings no you're not going to go to settings um your apps I'm gonna go back here and I'm gonna have the streamlit one I'm gonna say the settings on this app page and here we go so I want to call this um globalize come on now globalize text and call this globalized text awesome in the video I may just do the regular globalized one but you'll you'll know what we're doing there and then we'll click save links in the description cool and then all of a sudden what I can do is I can go to globalize text dot streamlit dot app and sweet there's my app right then and there so that's how we get our app up on streamlit so in this example we've only done prompt templates and some really simple language model things here but you can see how you can do some really awesome things like some of the other examples that we've done like querying a book well let me go put those embeddings up on Pinecone and I can query Pinecone from my application right here and then I can go ahead and create a new user interface so somebody can go query all the Paul Graham essays if they wanted to right here and get some answers for them so this is a very cool application it makes really excited to see what you come up with please leave uh comments on what you build and I'll make sure to include them in the descriptions and if you want to please at mention me on Twitter and I'll retweet to try to help gain some uh exposure for your apps there now thank you very much have fun\n",

We have a almost uniform distribution across the different experience levels which is great for the discussion later on .\", \" Deepsea is the company that organizes this event and it\\'s an open nlp meetup open to everyone but still we need some resources to organize that and actually i\\'m myself working at deepsea so working in the intersection of nlp and open source software . We\\'re looking for a team lead in open source engineering right now but also for senior software engineers .\", \" i\\'m very excited that we got two speakers here that that can really talk about very recent very advanced topics so dima is a principal data scientist at the silo ai and he\\'s also the host of the vector podcast [Music] that you can find on youtube so maybe you check that out later . ere are 20 minutes for the talk plus 10 minutes for a qa afterwards and then finally after that we will have some virtual get together in zoom breakout rooms so smaller groups to discuss a bit .\", \" i have 16 plus years of experience in in in search engines in different setups from startups to multinational giants . Part of this discussion will focus on the algorithm that we invented in the team called cso . i\\'m from from finland and so siso means greed or perseverance and this is exactly what we needed when we were part of this competition .\", \\' i will briefly introduce what is vector search in a nutshell . i will talk about main vector databases and also neural search frameworks that that that also make use of databases in some cases . i highly recommend you to find this presentation on youtube. i will also provide you some some practical materials that you can use if you would like to get into this topic and also if time permits i will show you a couple demos .\\', \" vector database is a fifth type of database type created and that\\'s vector database . vector search or neural search as some people call it is neural search versus inverted search . neural search is gaining its momentum in the space of the search space . i i claim that we witness the tectonic shift today when there is a . fifth type created in the . packet of nosql .\", \" A vector essentially will be something like an example here you know this is a floating point vector it could be integer or binary . At small scale let\\'s say you have thousands tens of thousands of objects in principle you could just use an exact k nearest neighbor search to find all the neighbors to your query right but at larger scale when you go to millions tens of millions you cannot do that because exact k n will be like a linear scan through your data set and uh it\\'s impossible to really like complete it within reasonable time .\", \\' Semantically, nearest neighbor search is powering semantic search today . E-commerce, e-commerce and zero heat long-tail problem are some of the reasons why people do this . Semantically search can also create multi-modal experiences so for example you could search images with text or maybe vice versa .\\', \" Big players are in the game, including spotify, microsoft and microsoft . e system doesn\\'t have uh you might as well instead of showing kind of predefined page use similarity search to find similar items . amazon is investing into this as well as part of open search this is like a fork of elasticsearch . facebook implemented a very famous framework called fis .\", \" There is always place to invent a new algorithm and so i would like max erwin to go through the algorithm that we invented as part of began and challenge yeah thanks dima dima . There\\'s no such thing as perfect you\\'re never going to get so up up up into the right is better .\", \\' i wanted to show this because this has been the catalyst for a site called an and benchmarks which has been around for a while which is actually started by eric bernhardson who created the annoy algorithm for spotify and a lot of other people .
